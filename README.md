🐍 Learning Python Through Projects
This repository is a collection of projects I'm building to learn and improve my Python skills. Instead of just reading syntax and theory, I'm diving into Python by building functional projects 

## 📌 Why this repo?

- To learn Python by doing real-world projects.
- To track my progress and keep myself accountable.
- To share with others who might be starting their Python journey too.
